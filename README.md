- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chris
- 👀 I’m interested in computational math (Physical-informed machine learning, sparse identification of dynamics, uncertainty quantifiation (gPC, MC, Bayesian)) and dynamic system theorem (chaotic time series analysis, attractor manifold, embedding theorem, spatial-temporal chaos).  
- 🌱 I’m have a bachler's degree in Reliability and system engineering and enconomy, a master degree in Mathematics (Probability theorem and computational math) and now focus on dynamic system theorem for epidemiology. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spatio-temporal dynamic sysmtem and uncertainty quantification.
